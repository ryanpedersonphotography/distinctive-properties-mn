## Key Development Patterns

### Routing & Navigation
- **CRITICAL**: Always use React Router's `<Link>` component for internal navigation
- NEVER use `<a href="/path">` for internal links - use `<Link to="/path">`
- Import Link from 'react-router-dom' when needed
- External links can use regular `<a>` tags with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`

### Styling
- Uses CSS variables defined in `:root` for consistent theming
- Component-specific CSS files (e.g., `Home.css`, `Gallery.css`)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Full-width sections with constrained content (max-width: 1400px)

### Design System
```css
--primary-color: #1a365d;
--primary-hover: #2c5282;
--accent-color: #3182ce;
--text-color: #333;
--light-gray: #f7fafc;
```

### SEO Implementation
- Dynamic SEO component on each page
- Local business structured data
- Meta tags for social sharing
- Sitemap included

### Contact Form
- Integrated with Netlify Forms
- Form name: "contact"
- Hidden bot field for spam protection
- Success/error handling with state management

## Deployment

- **Build Directory**: `dist`
- **SPA Redirects**: Configured in `netlify.toml`
- **Forms**: Netlify Forms enabled for contact form

### Domain Setup
- **Primary Domain**: distinctivepropertiesmn.com (to be configured)
- **Contact Email**: bpederson@distinctivepropertiesmn.com

## Testing
- Puppeteer scripts available for form testing
- No unit testing framework currently set up

- **Service Area**: Brainerd, Baxter, Nisswa, Pequot Lakes, Crosslake, Pillager, Motley, Staples, Pine River, Walker
- **Target Audience**: Real estate agents and homeowners in Central Minnesota

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Gallery Images
1. Add images to `public/images/gallery/`
2. Update the images array in `src/pages/Gallery.jsx`
3. Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed, appropriate dimensions)

### Modifying Service Areas
Update service areas in:
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` (service areas section)
- `src/components/Footer.jsx` (footer listing)
- `src/components/SEO.jsx` (structured data)

### Updating Contact Information
Contact details appear in:
- `src/components/Footer.jsx`
- `src/pages/Contact.jsx`
- `src/components/SEO.jsx` (structured data)

### Social Media
- Instagram: @distinctivepropertiesmn
- Footer displays only Instagram icon (Facebook and LinkedIn removed)

### Navigation Active States
The navbar uses React Router's NavLink component to show active page states:
- Active links display in accent color with underline
- Contact button has special active state styling
- Mobile menu shows active state with background color
- NavLink components automatically add 'active' class to current page
- Navigation includes: Home, Services, Gallery, Video, Aerial, 3D Tours, About, Book Now

### Recent UI Enhancements (June 26-27, 2025)

#### Contact Form Redesign
The contact form has been significantly enhanced for better user experience:
- **Larger, bolder design**: Increased padding (3.5rem), larger fonts (2.5rem heading)
- **Visual personality**: House emoji in header (🏠), camera emoji for services (📸)
- **Improved layout**: 
  - Services and time preference in styled containers with backgrounds
  - Better spacing between form elements (2rem margins)
  - Gradient submit button with hover animations
- **Enhanced interactions**:
  - Focus states with shadow rings
  - Hover effects on checkboxes and radio buttons
  - Animated success/error messages
- **Form fields include**:
  - Name, Email, Phone (in a two-column layout)
  - Property Address
  - Services checkboxes (styled grid)
  - Preferred Date
  - Preferred Shoot Time (radio buttons: Morning/Afternoon/Flexible)
  - Additional Details textarea

## Performance Considerations
- Images should be optimized before adding to the gallery
- Lightbox component lazy loads images
- CSS is split by component to reduce initial bundle size
- Framer Motion animations are kept lightweight

## CRITICAL: Layout Requirements

### Body Styling (DO NOT MODIFY)
The `body` element in `src/index.css` MUST maintain these specific styles for proper layout:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  display: flex;
  place-items: center;
  min-width: 320px;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

**WARNING**: Removing `display: flex` and `place-items: center` will break the entire site layout. These properties are essential for centering the React app container properly.

### Full-Width Sections
- Use `width: 100%` (NOT `100vw`) to prevent horizontal scrolling
- The negative margin technique (`margin-left: calc(-50vw + 50%)`) is used intentionally for full-width backgrounds
- Container content should be constrained with `max-width: 1400px`

### Lightbox Components
The site uses three specialized lightbox components:
- **Lightbox.jsx**: For image galleries with navigation
- **VideoLightbox.jsx**: For Vimeo video playback
- **MatterportLightbox.jsx**: For 3D virtual tours

All lightboxes use consistent styling and close with × button or overlay click.
