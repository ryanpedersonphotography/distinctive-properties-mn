# Form Submission Alternatives for Free Netlify Account

Since Netlify Forms might have limitations on free accounts, here are alternative solutions:

## Option 1: Formspree (Recommended)
Free tier: 50 submissions/month

1. Sign up at https://formspree.io
2. Create a form for robert.pederson@gmail.com
3. Update the form action in Contact.jsx:

```javascript
<form 
  action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"
  method="POST"
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  className="contact-form"
>
```

## Option 2: Web3Forms
Free tier: Unlimited submissions

1. Get API key at https://web3forms.com
2. No signup required - just enter robert.pederson@gmail.com
3. Update form to use their endpoint

## Option 3: EmailJS
Free tier: 200 emails/month

1. Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com
2. Set up email service
3. Use their JavaScript SDK

## Option 4: Google Forms
Completely free, unlimited submissions

1. Create a Google Form
2. Embed or redirect to it
3. Responses go to Google Sheets

## Current Issue
The Netlify Forms feature might be:
- Not available on free tier
- Require verification
- Need to be enabled in dashboard
