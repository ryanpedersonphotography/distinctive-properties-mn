# Form Status Update

## âœ… Form is now working!

The contact form has been successfully configured and tested:

1. **Email Updated**: Changed to rpederson@gmail.com
2. **Netlify Forms**: Properly configured with form detection
3. **Test Submission**: Successfully submitted via Puppeteer
4. **Success Message**: Displayed correctly after submission

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Email Notifications**:
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/distinctive-properties-mn/forms
   - Click on the "contact" form
   - Go to "Form notifications" 
   - Add email notification to: rpederson@gmail.com

2. **View Submissions**:
   - All form submissions are stored at: https://app.netlify.com/sites/distinctive-properties-mn/forms
   - You can export them as CSV if needed

## What Was Fixed

1. Updated email address in Contact.jsx
2. Ensured proper form HTML in index.html for Netlify detection
3. Added cache-busting query parameter to form submission
4. Deployed with form detection enabled

The form now successfully:
- Captures all fields (name, email, phone, address, services, date, message)
- Shows success message after submission
- Stores submissions in Netlify dashboard
- Ready for email notifications setup
