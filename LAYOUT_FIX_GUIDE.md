# Layout Issue Fixes for Distinctive Properties MN

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Body Flex Centering Conflict
**Problem**: The default Vite `index.css` was setting the body to `display: flex` with `place-items: center`, which conflicted with your normal document flow layout.

**Solution**: Removed the flex properties from the body in `index.css`.

### 2. Full-Width Section Overflow
**Problem**: Sections were using `margin-left: calc(-50vw + 50%)` to achieve full-width backgrounds, which can cause horizontal scrolling.

**Solution**: Removed the negative margin technique and ensured sections use `width: 100%` with proper container styling.

### 3. CSS Specificity Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple CSS files were styling the same elements with different properties.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `App.css` to explicitly set `display: block` on the body
- Added proper width constraints to the `#root` and `.App` containers
- Ensured the main element has `overflow-x: hidden`

## Additional Recommendations:

### 1. Test Responsiveness
Run the development server and test at different viewport sizes:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Debug Layout Issues
To help identify any remaining layout issues, you can temporarily import the debug CSS:

```jsx
// In App.jsx or main.jsx
import './debug.css'; // Remove after debugging
```

This will:
- Show red outlines around all elements
- Highlight containers in green
- Show viewport information
- Help identify elements causing overflow

### 3. Check for Console Errors
Open the browser console and look for any JavaScript errors that might be affecting layout.

### 4. Validate Video Loading
Ensure the hero video is loading properly. If not, the fallback image should display.

### 5. Further Optimizations
Consider these additional improvements:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Add lazy loading for images in the gallery
2. **Performance**: Use `will-change` CSS property sparingly for animations
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
4. **Mobile Menu**: Test the hamburger menu thoroughly on mobile devices

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on any device size
- [ ] Hero section displays properly with video/fallback image
- [ ] Navigation is sticky and doesn't cause layout shift
- [ ] All sections are properly contained within viewport
- [ ] Mobile menu opens and closes smoothly
- [ ] Footer stays at bottom of content
- [ ] Forms and interactive elements are accessible

## Common Commands:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

If issues persist, check:
1. Browser DevTools for specific elements causing overflow
2. Network tab to ensure all assets are loading
3. Console for any JavaScript errors
4. Responsive design mode to test different screen sizes
